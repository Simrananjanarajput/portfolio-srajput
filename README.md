# GitHub Portfolio – ISM 6225

A minimal, responsive portfolio for your assignment.

## How to use

1. Create a new public repo on GitHub, e.g. `portfolio-srajput`.
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repository root:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/styles.css`
   - (optional) `assets/profile.jpg` (your headshot or logo)
3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main` (folder `/root`) → **Save**
4. Your site will appear at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute.
5. Edit content:
   - In `index.html`, update your name, project links, and contact info.
   - Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_LINKEDIN` with your real profiles.

## Screenshot checklist (for assignment)
- Home/About section
- Projects section
- Skills section
- Settings → Pages screen showing the published URL
- Repo file tree (showing `index.html` and `assets/`)

## Notes
- Styles are kept simple (no build tools). Modify `assets/styles.css` as you like.
- If you add a photo, name it `profile.jpg` and place it in `assets/`.
